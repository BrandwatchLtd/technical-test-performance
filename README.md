# ðŸš€ Technical Test ðŸš€
The purpose of this test is to:
* Assess types of tests you think you should perform in order to verify performance of the application
* Assess your technical skills in coding - style and level
* Assess accuracy of your benchmarks

## ðŸ“• What you need to do:
Assume your application under test is https://gorest.co.in/, write different types of performance tests to:
1. How calling different endpoints can break the application?
2. What are the thresholds?
3. What causes the application to become un-responsive? (transaction locks/parallel access/particular sequence of calls)

The test scenarios are entirely up to you, and you may use additional endpoints if you feel they will provide better coverage and improve your coding solution. You will be evaluated on which test cases you create as well as on the overall quality and efficiency of your automation code (see evaluation section below).

**NOTE**: You are free to use any language & tool you are comfortable with.

## ðŸ“« Submitting the code
We take pride in keeping our Git history organised and easy to follow for the benefit of our code reviewers, so please organise your commits to reflect this.
Once complete, zip up your directory (including any .git files!) and send it to the recruiter you've been in contact with, including a summary of what you have done.
Please do not fork this repository or send in a pull request, since that would mean other applicants would be able to *cough* borrow *cough* your work!
 
## âœ… How will my work be evaluated?
Rome wasn't built in a day, and we are fair in our review given the time constraints. With this in mind, here are some of the things we are looking for:
* Is the code clean, well organised, and reusable
* Your understanding of the problem
* Scenarios Covered
* Coding Style
* Readability

Should you proceed to the next stage of the process, you may be asked to talk through the approach you took as well as what other approaches you might have taken or considered if more time would have been available. 
Good luck!
